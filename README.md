# Implementing_the_Dijstra_Algorithm
'Implementing_the_Dijkstra_Algorithm' repository contains the files of the graph algorithm project from the class 'Algorithms' at Handong Global University, conducted by Professor Junghyun Kim at the Department of AI convergence studies.

The Dijkstra Algorithm was implemented to find the shortest path between two nodes given a simplified graph where the nodes represent the airports and the edges represent the path between the airports.
