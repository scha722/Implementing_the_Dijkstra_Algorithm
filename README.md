# Implementing_the_Dijstra_Algorithm
'Implementing_the_Dijkstra_Algorithm' repository contains all project files from the class 'Algorithm' at Handong Global University, conducted by Professor Junghyun Kim at the Department of AI convergence studies
the Dijkstra Algorithm was implemented to solve the shortest path between two nodes given a simplified graph where the nodes represent the airports and the edges represent the path between the airports.
